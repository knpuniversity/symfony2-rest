title:  "Symfony RESTful API: Hypermedia, Links & Bonuses (Episode 5)"
summary: |
    After 4 episodes, we've somehow avoided the hottest buzzwords in REST:
    Hypermedia and HATEOAS. These can make your API awesome, or could bring
    you to your knees with fuzzy details, missing best practices and complexity.
    Let's make our API awesome:

    * Linking to Resources (and Hypermedia)
    * POSTing related resource ids (EntityToIdTransformer)
    * VirtualPropertys and Form property_paths
    * HATEOAS
    * Handling a Collection resource update
